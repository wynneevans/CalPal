# CalPal

This is the beginning of a simple calorie counter. 
Users can create a global list of foods, stating the name and calories per 100g of the food.

Then users simply list the food and quantity in grams to calculate their calorific intake per meal, day or week.

## Development Plan

Eventually my plan is to turn this into a web app built with Django.
